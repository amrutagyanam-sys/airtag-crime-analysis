  <h1>Apple AirTag Crime & Misuse Risk Analysis</h1>
  <p>
    Independent academic research (sole author) examining security, privacy,
    and misuse risks of Apple AirTags as a consumer IoT tracking technology,
    with a focus on governance, digital safety, and public-interest risk analysis.
  </p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project is an independently conducted academic research study analyzing
    the security, privacy, and misuse risks associated with Apple AirTags.
    While AirTags are designed to help users locate personal belongings,
    their Bluetooth-based proximity tracking and reliance on a large community
    network introduce risks related to unauthorized tracking, stalking,
    and vehicle theft.
  </p>
  <p>
    The research combines technical analysis, legal and constitutional study,
    law-enforcement consultation, and governance-focused risk assessment
    to identify control gaps and propose mitigation strategies aligned with
    privacy, accountability, and public safety principles.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology Background</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Apple AirTag is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tracking device released in 2021.
      It operates through Apple’s <em>Find My</em> network, where nearby Apple devices
      anonymously relay location information using end-to-end encryption.
      AirTags do not contain GPS; instead, they rely on proximity-based detection
      within the Apple ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supported devices leverage Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology through the U1 chip
      to enable Precision Finding. While Apple emphasizes privacy-by-design,
      the effectiveness of these protections depends on ecosystem participation,
      device compatibility, and user awareness.

  <h2>Risk & Misuse Scenarios</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Covert placement of AirTags on vehicles or personal belongings without consent</li>
      <li>Stalking and intimate-partner abuse enabled by prolonged unauthorized tracking</li>
      <li>Vehicle theft facilitated through pre-tracking of high-value targets</li>
      <li>Delayed or missed alerts, particularly for non-Apple users</li>
      <li>Confusion between false positives and real threats leading to delayed response</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Legal & Law-Enforcement Context</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Studied U.S. constitutional privacy principles including consent and reasonable expectation of privacy</li>
      <li>Reviewed legal challenges in prosecuting technology-enabled stalking cases</li>
      <li>Independently engaged in informational discussions with the Murray City Police Department
          (under faculty supervision) to understand reporting workflows and investigative constraints</li>
      <li>Identified gaps between technical detection mechanisms and legal response capabilities</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Governance & Control Gaps</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Limited cross-platform detection for non-Apple users</li>
      <li>Inconsistent user awareness and response guidance</li>
      <li>Reliance on post-incident alerts rather than preventive safeguards</li>
      <li>Absence of clear policy frameworks for digitally assisted stalking cases</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Risk Mitigation & Recommendations</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Strengthen cross-platform tracking detection and alert mechanisms</li>
      <li>Improve public education on tracking risks and response actions</li>
      <li>Enhance collaboration between technology providers and law enforcement</li>
      <li>Incorporate privacy-by-design controls to reduce silent tracking misuse</li>
      <li>Develop governance and policy guidance for digital stalking investigations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Tools & Methods</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <ul>
      <li>Technical documentation and platform behavior analysis</li>
      <li>Legal and constitutional research</li>
      <li>Law-enforcement advisory and case-study review</li>
      <li>Academic literature analysis</li>
      <li>Risk and governance modeling</li>
