# AirTag Criminal Misuse – Cybersecurity & Data Governance Portfolio  
**Author:** Amrutha Gyanam  
**Role:** Cybersecurity • Data Governance • IAM • Cloud Security  

This repository contains my professional case study on the criminal misuse of Apple AirTags in  
**cyberstalking, vehicle tracking, coercive control, and IoT-enabled surveillance**.

What began as my graduate research project has evolved into a **professional threat-analysis portfolio** 
aligned with SOC operations, threat intelligence, digital forensics, data governance, IAM, and cloud security roles.
